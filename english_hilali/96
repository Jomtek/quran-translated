1. Read! In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists),
2. Has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).
3. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous,
4. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen (the first person to write was Prophet Idrees (Enoch) ),
5. Has taught man that which he knew not.
6. Nay! Verily, man does transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deed, etc.).
7. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.
8. Surely! Unto your Lord is the return.
9. Have you (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) seen him (i.e. Aboo Jahl) who prevents,
10. A slave (Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) when he prays?
11. Tell me, if he (Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) is on the guidance (of Allah)?
12. Or enjoins piety?
13. Tell me if he (the disbeliever, Aboo Jahl) denies (the truth, i.e. this Quran), and turns away?
14. Knows he not that Allah does see (what he does)?
15. Nay! If he (Aboo Jahl) ceases not, We will catch him by the forelock,
16. A lying, sinful forelock!
17. Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers),
18. We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!
19. Nay! (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him))! Do not obey him (Aboo Jahl). Fall prostrate and draw near to Allah
